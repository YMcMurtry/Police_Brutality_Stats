# Police_Brutality_Stats

BACKGROUND
Incidents of police brutality receive an abundance of media attention. It was my intention to investigate the numbers without the influence of media bias in either direction. 
MOTIVATION
The police department has a long, dark history riddled with crimes and cover-ups against disenfranchised peoples. From the media perspective, the system needs to be entirely overhauled. However, my father-in-law is a police sergeant so with and through him I have met many good, well-intentioned officers as well as heard some of the challenges they face with the hiring pool, training and the systems in place.  Additionally, I was raised with a healthy skepticism toward government institutions thanks to political power grabs that destroyed the socioeconomic system of both my parents’ countries of origin. I would like to think there is a path to a solution or change.
DATA DESCRIPTION
The data I chose was from the Washington Post and spanned from 2013 through 4/30/2024. It includes every case in which a person died at the hands of the police within that timeframe.  The data is not always complete as police departments do not always disclose the names of officers.

DATA QUESTIONS
- Of the cases where lethal force was used, what percentage was a response to a violent crime?
- How many of those lethal cases were against non-Caucasian?
- What gender is most represented?
- Are the numbers decreasing or increasing?
- Is that proportionate to the population and the distribution therein?
